The purpose of JTE is to project forces from the air, land or sea into foreign and/or contested airspace, territorial waters and territory to conduct operations. It helps Defence achieve its strategic objectives by shaping the environment, contributing to the rules-based international order and preventing regional instability.

A [[theatre of operations]] can consist of several joint operations areas, span vast distances and be affected by the adversary before the joint force deploys.

When conducting power projection operations, a joint force will have to gain and maintain access to an operational area to achieve a degree of freedom of manoeuvre/action to conduct and accomplish missions. Therefore the entry force may have to secure a [[lodgement]].  Once a lodgement has been achieved, the threat to a joint force does not dissipate; rather an adversary will likely switch from anti-access measures to shorter-range area denial.

## Amphibious operations
a military operation launched from the sea by a naval and landing force embarked in ships or craft, with the principal aim of projecting the landing force ashore tactically into an environment ranging from permissive to hostile.
#### Ship to objective manoeuvre.
Ship to objective manoeuvre is an operational technique used by the landing force to project ashore. It seeks to create a decisive effect by using the agility of amphibious forces to strike at the points of greatest opportunity. This is achieved using a combination of surface manoeuvre landing craft, and air manoeuvre. Air manoeuvre is fundamental to ship to objective manoeuvre, as it gives the ability to reach beyond the shore and strike directly on the objective or to secure key terrain. Air assault is the primary type of air manoeuvre used. Ship to objective manoeuvre avoids the delay of a classic amphibious assault where there is a requirement to build up combat power in a beachhead before moving to the objective. Figure 3.1 compares a traditional amphibious assault with a ship to objective manoeuvre.

## Opening a lodgement
For a hostile or non-permissive environment joint theatre entry, initial theatre opening activities may begin at a forward mounting base until the lodgement is sufficiently secure. Theatre opening tasks include: 

• establishing the air port of disembarkation or sea port of disembarkation; 
• identifying and establishing a joint logistic support area;
• establishing the [[RSOI]] infrastructure; 
• establish communications links; 
• establishing a movement control framework; 
• establishing force protection;
• preparing to open the Defence Support Chain; and 
• identifying and establishing main and alternative supply routes.

Once a lodgement has been secured, the strategic air bridge must be established to enable timely strategic evacuations of any casualties sustained.

## Planning Process
a. The ground tactical plan.  The commander must work out what their scheme of manoeuvre and objectives will be to help inform the logistic planners. This will allow them to work backwards from the plan to ensure the operation is successful. (NOTE: e.g. work out what the objective is, so you know what you need to supply to achieve it.)
b. The landing plan.  The landing plan must take into account the desired order of arrival in theatre of the troops and equipment that will form the main intervention force. Ideally this will have been decided before the main intervention force deploys but, if this is not possible, the force could use a forward mounting base to reload ships, landing craft or aircraft.
c. The movement plan.  The movement plan supports the landing plan by directing the order in which ships and their troops and equipment arrive in the joint operations area and the order in which they are to be used. 
d. The loading plan.  The loading plan should direct the order in which the joint forces are arranged on ships or aircraft. They should be loaded in reverse order to that which they will be used for disembarkation. The joint force should spend no longer on board their transport than necessary. Any additional time risks the transport becoming vulnerable to enemy action and prevents their effective and efficient use. In addition, any loading plan should ensure that the equipment required for the landing be available to the troops. 
e. The staging plan.  The staging plan should facilitate the loading plan, in particular ensuring that troops are called forward in the right sequence and at the correct time to board their transport.
