 Admiral Mountbatten called his team into a bathroom on board where a bath had been part filled. Floating on the bath water were 40 or so ships made out of newspaper. The most junior officer present, Lt Commander Grant RN, was directed to make waves using the back of a bath brush. Of course the paper vessels all sank as a result. The demonstration was then repeated with the paper warships placed inside the protective ring of a _‘Mae West’_ lifebelt. Mountbatten then gave the command: _“More waves please Lieutenant Grant.”_ All the senior naval onlookers were then pleased to see that all ships remained afloat!
 
Once the allied commanders had reached agreement, the order was given to Mountbatten’s Combined Operations to deal with practicalities the idea and bring it to fruition. As the task proved too big for the limited resources available, the project was contracted out to the War Department to get the attention needed.
