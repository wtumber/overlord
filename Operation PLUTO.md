> the Pipe Line Under The Ocean

Initially ran from the Isle of Wight to France and was intended to supply a large proportion of the petrol which would sustain the 21st Army Group.

The POL supply situation was satisfactory throughout June and July, mainly because the rate of advance was much slower than anticipated, resulting in shorter supply lines and lower fuel consumption. 

The British [War Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office "War Office") estimated that [petrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol "Petrol"), [oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil "Oil"), and [lubricants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubricant "Lubricant") would account for more than 60 per cent of the weight of supplies required by the expeditionary forces. Pipelines would reduce the need for [coastal tankers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_tanker "Coastal tanker"), which could be hindered by bad weather, were subject to air attack, and needed to be offloaded into vulnerable storage tanks ashore. A new kind of pipeline was required that could be rapidly deployed. Two types were developed, named "Hais" and "Hamel" after their inventors. Two pipeline systems were laid, each connected by camouflaged pumping stations to the [Avonmouth-Thames pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLH_Pipeline_System "CLH Pipeline System").

The first was the not-very-successful "Bambi" project, which connected [Sandown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandown "Sandown") on the [Isle of Wight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight "Isle of Wight") to [[Cherbourg]] in [Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy "Normandy"). Deployment of Bambi began on 12 August 1944, and it delivered just 3,300 long tons (3,400 t) between 22 September, when the first pipeline became operational, and 4 October, when it was terminated. More successful was "Dumbo", which ran from [Dungeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeness "Dungeness") on the [Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent "Kent") coast to [[Boulogne]] in [[Pas-de-Calais]]. 
The Dumbo system began pumping on 26 October, expanded to 17 pipelines by December, and remained in action until 7 August 1945. Ultimately, the pipelines carried about 8 per cent of all petroleum products sent from the United Kingdom to the Allied Expeditionary Force in North West Europe, including some 180 million imperial gallons (820 million litres) of petrol.

 Pipelines were not the sole or even the principal means by which Combined Operations was contemplating supplying bulk petroleum; it intended to rely primarily on small shallow-draught [coastal tankers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_trading_vessel "Coastal trading vessel"), of which thirty were under construction. American 600-deadweight-ton "Y" tankers began arriving in the UK in the spring of 1944. In 1943, the British also initiated a programme to construct 400-deadweight-ton (410-deadweight-tonne) [Channel tankers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHANT_(ship_type) "CHANT (ship type)") (Chants), but only 37 were completed by May 1944. It was hoped that petroleum products might also be supplied by ocean-going [T2 tankers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2_tanker "T2 tanker") lying offshore through ship-to-shore pipelines. The project to develop these pipelines was codenamed [[Operation Tombola]], and the pipelines themselves became known as Tombolas. The submarine pipeline had sufficient advantages to make it worthwhile to explore as a backup means of supply. Submarine pipelines were less susceptible to enemy air attack and the frequently stormy English Channel weather, and their use would reduce the forces' dependency on vulnerable storage tanks ashore.

## Placement

### Bambi
According to the original [[Operation Overlord]] plan, [[Cherbourg]] was supposed to be captured within D+8 and, despite the expectation that the Germans would carry out systematic demolitions, be opened within three days. Pipe laying was to commence four days later, with the Bambi system fully operational by D+75. The discovery of an additional German division in the vicinity in May led to the expected capture being pushed back ten days from D+8 to D+18. In the event, the port of [[Cherbourg]] was captured on 27 June (D+21), and due to the extensive damage the first POL tanker did not discharge there until 25 July (D+49) In the meantime, fuel was supplied through the small port of [[Port-en-Bessin]] by coastal tankers, and from ocean-going tankers using two Tombola lines at Port-en-Bessin for the British and five at [Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes "Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes") for the Americans. The Tombola lines had a tendency to break, and the Chants fared poorly in the rough weather of the English Channel. By 28 July sixteen of them were laid up for repairs at a special tanker repair facility that had been established at [[Hamble-le-Rice]].

on 22 September a Hais cable was laid that worked, delivering 56,000 imperial gallons (250,000 L) per day. This was followed on 29 September by the successful installation of a Hamel cable by HMS _Conundrum 2_. However, on 3 October when the pressure was increased from 50 to 70 bars (730 to 1,020 psi) to augment the amount of fuel pumped, both pipelines failed: the Hais due to a faulty [coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling "Coupling"), and the Hamel when it encountered a sharp edge on the ocean floor. Operation Bambi was terminated the following day. Only about 3,300 long tons (3,400 t) (935,000 imperial gallons (4,250,000 L)) of fuel had been transferred.

### Dumbo
Boulogne was captured on 22 September, and the port was opened on 22 October.
A Hais pipeline was laid by HMS _Sancroft_, which commenced pumping on 26 October, and remained in action until the end of the war.
Boulogne also had poor railway facilities, so the pipeline was extended to [[Calais]] where better railway connections were available to transport the fuel. This extension was completed in November.
By December, nine 3-inch and two 2-inch Hamel pipelines and four 3-inch and two 2-inch Hais cable pipelines had been laid, a total of 17 pipelines,) and Dumbo was providing 1,300 long tons (1,300 t) of petrol per day.


In December there was reconsideration of whether to continue with Operation Pluto. By this time [[Antwerp]] was unloading an ocean-going tanker a day, and coastal tankers were delivering 2,500 to 3,000 long tons (2,500 to 3,000 t) Antwerp was under attack from [V-1 flying bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-1_flying_bomb "V-1 flying bomb") and [V-2 rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2_rocket "V-2 rocket"), and it was considered inadvisable for it handle more than one tanker at a time. As for the coastal tankers, they were in demand for service in the Far East. It was therefore decided to continue with Operation Pluto.
Dumbo surpassed its target of 1 million imperial gallons (4.5 million litres) (about 3,000 long tons (3,000 t)) per day on 15 March 1945, and by 3 April the Dumbo lines were delivering 4,500 long tons (4,600 t) a day to the [[Rhine]].

Operation Pluto was officially disbanded on 31 August, and the Petroleum Warfare Department was wound up on 31 March 1946.

Operation Pluto contributed 370 thousand long tons (380 thousand tonnes) or 8 per cent.
