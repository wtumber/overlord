Operation Neptune was the name of the amphibious operation part of Operation Overland.
### Ports 

In addition to the Mulberry, small ports were used; 
[[Courseulles]], which was mainly used by fishing boats, had a draught of 2.9 metres (9 ft 6 in), making it suitable only for shallow-draught vessels, such as barges. A daily average of 860 tonnes (850 long tons) was unloaded there in June, rising to 1,500 tonnes (1,500 long tons) in July and August. Operations ceased on 7 September.

[[Port-en-Bessin]] was operated as a bulk petroleum terminal, servicing both the British and American forces. Shallow-draught oil tankers drawing up to 4.3 metres (14 ft) could enter the port and larger tankers up to 5,000 gross register tons (14,000$m^2$) could discharge using [[Tombolas]], floating ship-to-shore lines. Two ship-to-shore lines were in operation by 25 July, and six tanker berths were in operation, with pipelines connected to the bulk petroleum storage terminal, which had a capacity of 10,000 tonnes (9,800 long tons) of petrol and 2,000 tonnes (2,000 long tons) of aviation fuel. 
The port was opened to store ships on 12 June, and to tankers on 24 June. Some 87,000 tonnes (86,000 long tons) of petrol was discharged by 31 July, and a daily average of 11,304 tonnes (11,125 long tons) of stores were discharged until the port was closed on 25 September.
[[Cherbourg]] was captured by the Americans on 27 June but it was very badly damaged and was not opened to shipping until 16 July. Some 510 tonnes (500 long tons) of its daily capacity was allocated to the British. It contained the only deep-water berths in Allied hands and was useful in reducing the load on Port-en-Bessin. 

The railway line from [[Cherbourg]] to [[Caen]] commenced operation on 26 July, using rolling stock captured near [[Bayeux]]. The lack of deep water berths meant that a large proportion of the supplies shipped went in coasters that could discharge at the small ports rather than in large, ocean-going Liberty ships.
It was hoped that [[Cherbourg]] could handle large and awkward loads, but it had been so badly damaged that it was not sufficiently rehabilitated to do so until late August. In the meantime, they were shipped already loaded on transporters, or unloaded from lighters by cranes at [[Courseulles]] or [[Port-en-Bessin]]. Although manifests were flown across each day, there was still trouble identifying cargo.
The British beaches were closed on 3 September 1944. By this time 221,421 tonnes (217,924 long tons) had been discharged through small ports, 615,347 tonnes (605,629 long tons) over open beaches, and 458,578 tonnes (451,335 long tons) through Mulberry B. 
This meant that: 
* 25 per cent of the total tonnage had been landed through Cherbourg and the small ports, 
* 12.5 per cent through Mulberry B, 
* and 62.5 per cent over the beaches. 

The tonnage handled over the beaches greatly exceeded the expectations of the planners; but **it is unlikely that the invasion would have been launched in the first place without the reassurance provided by the Mulberry.**

### American Logistics
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_logistics_in_the_Normandy_campaign
The logistical planners saw the campaign unfolding in three stages. 
* In the first, an automatic supply system would be used, with materiel dispatched on a predetermined schedule. 
* In the second stage, which would occur after a lodgment was secured and supply depots began functioning, the system would become semi-automatic, with items like ammunition shipped on the basis of status reports.
* In the third stage, which would occur when the major ports were opened and the supply system was functioning smoothly, all items would be sent on requisition.
In the event, the war ended before the third stage was achieved.

Since the first three months of supply shipments were determined in advance, and the first two weeks already loaded on ships, three expedients were prepared to cover unanticipated shortfalls. 
* The first was codenamed the "[[Red Ball Express]]". Starting on D plus 3 (three days after D-Day), 100 measurement tons (110 m3) per day were set aside for emergency requests. Such shipments would be expedited. 
* The second, codenamed "Greenlight", provided for 600 measurement tons (680 m3) of ammunition and engineer equipment to be substituted for scheduled shipments of engineer supplies. This would become available from D plus 14 onwards, and Greenlight supplies would take up to six days for delivery. 
* Finally, supplies were packed with parachutes for aerial delivery to isolated units, and plans were made for the delivery of 6,000 pounds (2,700 kg) of supplies per day by air once airfields had been secured, with 48 hours warning.

The Overlord plan called for the early capture of Cherbourg, and a rapid American advance to secure the [[Brittany]] ports and [[Quiberon Bay]], which was to be developed as a port ([[Operation Chastity]]). The Brittany ports were not expected to be in operation until D+60.
Crucially, the logistical plan called for a one-month pause at the [[Seine]] River, which was expected to be reached by D + 90, before continuing the advance to the German border. The expectation of an advance at a prescribed rate, while necessary for planning purposes, built inflexibility into a logistics plan that already had little margin for error. Staff studies confirmed that Overlord could be supported if everything went according to plan.

Only one administrative airfield was available by the end of July, at [[Colleville-sur-Mer]] near [[Omaha Beach]]. Nonetheless, cross-Channel air flights commenced on 10 June. Air supply was heavily used during the week after the storm, with 1,400 long tons (1,400 t) of supplies, mostly ammunition, landed. By the end of July, 7,000 long tons (7,100 t) had been delivered by air. In addition, 25,959 casualties were evacuated by air in June and July, compared to 39,118 by sea.

## Grand Strategy

Operation Overlord, the Allied landings at Normandy in World War II gives us a good platform to see how the different levels worked together.  

The Grand strategic decision was made in 1942 when Britain and United States promised the USSR that they would open a new front on continental Europe. At that time the Eastern Front was the only European battleground left and the USSR was suffering badly. It was hoped that a second front would relieve some of this pressure.  
  
Two strategies were proposed. Churchill wanted to use irregulars (resistance troops) throughout most of Europe with a main thrust coming from the Mediterranean through Austria and into Germany. The US on the other hand wanted to take the shortest route to Germany from the strongest Allied power-base which at the time was Britain. The Americans got their way.  
  
The choice of attacking Hitler to his west was therefore made for grand strategic reasons. The choice of a Channel landing was made for strategic reasons, but the choice of landing site would be mainly from tactical and logistical considerations. The main tactical reason was that the Canadians had shown in 1942 at Dieppe that taking a fortified harbour town by direct frontal assault was difficult, so a decision was made to land at suitable beaches.  
  
The main logistical input to the strategic considerations had to do with air support. The Allied fighter aircraft based in Britain had very limited range thus limiting the part of the continental coast that could be covered. Geography then further limited the possible sites to just two: The Pas de Calais and Normandy. Pas de Calais was closer and was the obvious choice.  
  
A strategic decision was made that a fake landing expedition would be mounted in Kent to threaten Pas de Calais and the real invasion would be launched in secret at Normandy. This strategy was heavily influenced by tactical concerns. The German high command knew that Pas de Calais was the best landing site and it was therefore heavily fortified.  
  
The most demanding logistical exercises are naval invasions. Given infinite ships that can move across the widest straits in no time it would be easy, but in the real world you never have an infinite number of ships available and they're always slow.  
  
The Allies in World War II certainly had a logistical problem when they were planning the Normandy invasions: 47 divisions(about 140,000 men); 6,000 ships (including 4,000 landing craft, and 130 warships for bombardment); 12,000 aircraft and 5,000 tons of bombs. And it wasn't just the initial invasion force.  
  
After the invasion the men had to eat, get new ammunition and later be relieved (after five days there were over 325,000 men in Normandy). Tanks drink a lot of fuel. Trucks are much faster for moving infantry units about than making them walk but then the trucks needed to get there and they needed fuel and spare parts too. Back in England, before any of this can happen though the munitions, trucks, tanks and parts all had to be manufactured, shipped to the coast and put on boats. All of this had to happen at the right time or the invasion would fail. This logistical exercise took a lot more manpower and time to plan and then to administer than the strategic considerations did.  
  
The tactics employed on the day included the bombing of the main defences, the para-trooping of special infantry units in behind enemy lines to try to take out major armaments and gliders to put men and equipment behind enemy lines
