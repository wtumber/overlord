- **Operation Duration:** 17 to 25 September 1944
- **Location:** German-occupied Netherlands
- **Objective:** Create a 64 mi (103 km) salient into German territory, securing a bridgehead over the Lower Rhine River
- **Allied Forces:**
    - **Airborne:** First Allied Airborne Army with over 41,000 soldiers
    - **Land:** XXX Corps of the British Second Army with ten armoured and motorised brigades
- **German Forces:** Approximately 100,000 soldiers
- **Outcome:**
    - **Allied Casualties:** 8,000 dead, missing, and captured out of 12,000 in the British 1st Airborne Division
    - **German Actions:** Counterattack at Nijmegen, starvation blockade in the Netherlands
    - **Final Capture of Arnhem:** April 1945

### Purpose
The purpose of Operation Market Garden was to secure a strategic bridgehead over the Lower [[Rhine]] River, creating a route for Allied forces to invade northern Germany.
### Outcome

The operation achieved several tactical successes, capturing Eindhoven, Nijmegen, and some V-2 rocket sites, but failed to secure the critical bridge at Arnhem. The British 1st Airborne Division suffered heavy casualties and was ultimately withdrawn. The operation's failure prolonged the war in the Netherlands and resulted in severe civilian hardship due to German reprisals.

### Chronological Stages

1. **Preparation and Objectives:**
    - Plan to seize nine bridges using airborne forces (Operation Market)
    - Land forces (Operation Garden) to advance swiftly over the captured bridges
2. **Airborne Drop:**
    - First Allied Airborne Army drops over 41,000 soldiers near key bridges
3. **Land Advance:**
    - XXX Corps advances from the south along a single road, aiming to reach Arnhem in 48 hours
4. **Initial Successes:**
    - Capture of Eindhoven and Nijmegen
    - Seizure of several towns and V-2 rocket launching sites
5. **German Resistance:**
    - German forces halt the armoured brigades before Arnhem
    - British 1st Airborne Division unable to secure Arnhem bridge
6. **Withdrawal and Casualties:**
    - British 1st Airborne Division suffers heavy losses; partial evacuation
    - Remaining troops aided by Dutch underground until Operation Pegasus rescue
7. **German Counterattack:**
    - Failed German counterattack on Nijmegen salient
    - German blockade leads to starvation in the Netherlands
8. **Aftermath:**
    - Arnhem captured by Allies in April 1945

### Logistical and Strategic Aspects

Operation Market Garden was ambitious, relying on precise timing and coordination between airborne and ground forces. The plan involved dropping airborne troops behind enemy lines to capture key bridges, which ground forces would then quickly secure and advance over. The operation's success hinged on rapid movement along a single road through vulnerable terrain, leading to congestion and delays. The failure to anticipate the strength and readiness of German forces near Arnhem, as well as the logistical challenges of reinforcing and supplying the airborne troops, contributed to the operation's ultimate failure. Historians have criticized the planning for its over-ambition and underestimation of the German response, highlighting the difficulties in coordinating complex, multi-phased operations under combat conditions.

### Logistics

By late August the allied armies were running out of petroleum gasoline. Several allied divisions and corps were forced to halt their advance temporarily to replenish supplies. There was no shortage of fuel in the **makeshift ports in Normandy**; the difficulty lay in transporting sufficient quantities from Normandy to the armies in Belgium and northern France. Most arrived at the front in five gallon jerry cans after being transported hundreds of kilometres by trucks [[Red Ball Express]] from makeshift ports in Normandy. A potential solution was to capture a large port more accessible to the advancing allied armies. On 4 September, Montgomery's troops captured the massive port of Antwerp in Belgium virtually intact, but the Scheldt Estuary leading to it and preventing its use was still under German control. Neither Eisenhower nor Montgomery initially made opening the port of Antwerp a top priority and Antwerp was not used by allied supply ships until 28 November after the [Battle of the Scheldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Scheldt "Battle of the Scheldt"). The allied failure to win access quickly to the port of Antwerp has been called "one of the greatest tactical mistakes of the war". Churchill later acknowledged that "clearing the Scheldt Estuary and opening the port of Antwerp had been delayed for the sake of the Arnhem thrust. Thereafter it was given first priority."
