Each Mulberry Harbour – a code name that has no deeper meaning – gave Allied troops about 1 square mile of quiet, wave-free ocean from which to stage the invasion.
## Background

French seaports were heavily defended and could be disabled by retreating Germans.
Learnings from [[Dieppe]] suggest that ports cannot be taken without incurring crippling losses.

Investigations were started in deep secrecy as far back as 1941, looking at various ways to construct such a moveable harbour. In common with the wide and varied development of the D-Day idea, it was the civilian population and engineering capabilities in Britain which rose to the challenge of such a grand construction. As theories grew and ideas came forward, there are stories of dispute and argument between the Allies, with British and American plans differing wildly. Amongst the oddest of these is the ‘[[Queen Mary Demonstration]]’.

### Locations
Mulberry Harbour A was located at [[Omaha Beach]].
Mulberry Harbour B was located at [[Gold beach]].
## Designs

Three designs were selected for further evaluation. 
* The first from the War Office was for flexible steel bridges on pontoons of steel or concrete with pier-head units on adjustable legs to take account of the tides. 
* The second from the Admiralty was a flexible floating construction of timber and canvas held together with steel cables and similar in appearance to a Swiss Roll in its stored condition.  
	* When Hamilton's Swiss Roll roadway was tested with a 3 ton tipper truck the roadway sank in under two hours. Adjustments were made but further tests in the open sea confirmed that the heaviest load that could be carried was 7 tons - far below what was necessary for the movement of tanks. The Swiss Roll roadway design was soon abandoned.
* The third from Iorys Hughes envisaged the use of steel bridges to be mounted on concrete caissons and floated to the sites and sunk in position.
	* Hughes' three 'Hippo' caissons were towed to the site in Rigg Bay near Garlieston. Two 'Croc' roadways were attached to the metal bars on the Hippos and various combinations were tested in a variety of weather and tidal conditions. Fully laden vehicles were driven across the roadway. The testing proved invaluable since the behaviour of the components could be analysed and corrective action taken where necessary. It was found that the floating piers did not rise and fall with the tide as predicted but Hughes found a solution in the provision of adjustable spans between the Hippos and the roadway. A more serious problem was the unexpected pitching and yawing of the Hippos causing the attached Croc roadways to buckle. Hughes proposed the construction of Hippos of diminishing size on which the roadways would sit.
## Mulberry components

[[Breakwaters]]
-  **Bombardons** - floating breakwaters comprising huge, metal, crucifix shaped structures ballasted and firmly anchored in place. They were the outermost barrier and therefore the first line of defence against rough seas.
-  **Phoenexes** - 146 concrete caissons 60 metres long, 18 metres high and 15 metres wide making up 9.5 kilometres of breakwater. They were airtight floating cases open at the bottom with air-cocks to lower them to the sea-bed in a controlled fashion. Around 2 million tons of steel and concrete were used in their construction.
-  **Gooseberries** - 70 obsolete merchant vessels (block ships) were amassed at Oban on the west coast of Scotland, stripped down, ballasted and primed with explosive scuttling charges The vessels sailed under their own steam and were sunk in 5 locations including the 2 Mulberry harbours.

Pierheads
-  **Pierheads** were located at the seaward end of the roadways. Each stood on four legs called (Spuds) with a platform that could be raised and lowered with the tide by means of electric winches. 23 were planned for of which 8 were spares.

 Roadways
-  **Beetles** - concrete and steel floats or pontoons to support the roadways. Each capable of taking the weight of 56 tons + 25 tons (being the weight of a tank).
-  **Whales** - 16 kilometres of roadways.
-  **Buffer** - approach span from the floating roadway to beach.
-  **Rhino** - power driven pontoon on which cargo was brought ashore.

## Result

 These breakwaters provided a good measure of protection during and after the construction of the 2 Mulberry harbours and in the other beach locations. The [[Utah]] beach was a major logistical supply base for the Americans up to November '44 thanks to the protection afforded by its 'Gooseberry.'
 
Each day around 9000 tons were landed via Mulberry B until the end of August by which time [[Cherbourg]] port became available for use at least  in part and, towards the end of the year, after the capture of [[Walcheren]] the port of [[Antwerp]]. Mulberry B was in use for 5 months during which time over 2 million men, half a million vehicles and 4 million tons of supplies passed through the harbour. During this period several additional caissons where used to reinforce weak points in the breakwater. 

## Figures

From the time it was put into operation, D+4 until the 31st of October, 1944, 628,000 tons of supplies, 40,000 vehicles and 220,000 troops were put ashore in the sheltered area afforded by MULBERRY "B". Expressed in another way, 35% of the British stores, 17% of the British vehicles and 23% of the British personnel were landed inside the Mulberry.

It was used for 10 months after D-Day and over two and a half million men, 500,000 vehicles, and four million tonnes of supplies were landed using it before it was fully decommissioned. (JTE article)

From D plus 4 on it had been planned to handle 6,000 tons of stores a day at MULBERRY "B", actually, however, from the 20th of June to the 1st of September the port averaged 6,765 tons a day.

For the month of November the British plan to bring in three MT ships a day and the U.S. intend to land 11,500 tons of stores a day from Liberties. It is planned to close the port the 1st of December, 1944.
### End of use

The seizure of [[Antwerp]], on 4 September, and of [[Le Havre]], on 12 September, effectively ended the lack of harbour facilities. It would still take a long time before Antwerp could be used, but le Havre was first used on 9 October. The _Mulberry_ harbour ,at this stage, was only used for unloading American Liberty ships and for accumulating emergency stocks. Finally the harbour was shut down on 31 October.  
The following reasons for the closure were given:

- Belgian and Dutch ports could be used which were nearer to the front
- Existing ports offered better rail possibilities. _Mulberry B_ had no connection to the railroad network which meant that all further transport had to be done by truck.
- The rapid degradation of the roads to and from the _Mulberry_ harbour. The roads were totally disrupted because of the huge number of vehicles that had travelled over them. The roads had to be laid down once more.
- The silting of the harbour. Sandbanks appeared around the harbours; the harbour facilities were silting rapidly.

#### Recycling of parts

The various parts of the _Mulberries_ could well be used after deconstruction. The bridge parts of the floating roads were used as normal bridges. In this way ,Bailey Bridge material was saved. The Phoenix caissons were ,where possible, refloated and were used for repairing harbours like Le Havre and for repairing the dykes at Walcheren which had been deliberately bombed by the allies. After VE Day, various steel parts of the harbour were handed over to the French, who could deploy the steel in approximately 60 reconstruction projects.

### Mulberry effect

There are those who believe that Mulberry was unnecessary as exampled by the Americans success in landing supplies directly onto the beaches after the abandonment of Mulberry A.

Without a strong and reliable supply line, any military advance would quickly falter and collapse, with troops inevitably being forced back into the sea. It would be [[Dunkirk]] repeated. Beyond this, by skilful and fast establishment of this novel harbour construction, the Allies could avoid predictability.

Even ignoring the heavy equipment, vehicles, tanks and weapons, a typical serviceman would need 6½ pounds of supplies per day to keep him effective in the field.

On D-Day 6th June over 150,000 men landed on the five beaches. That’s well over 400 tons of supplies needed per day just to look after them. By the time Operation Neptune ended, over a million men had landed in Normandy; that’s a demand of 3,000 tons of consumable supplies per day! As the *majority of vessels were incapable of beach landing, a secure harbour was essential,* with a roadway link directly in to the transport and distribution system on land.

Once landings had been effected and a beachhead secured, it was found that both main Ports of [[Cherbourg]] and [[Le Havre]] were so badly damaged that neither could be used effectively for at least 6 months.
